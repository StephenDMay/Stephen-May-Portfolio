## Projects


### FindMyParadise
#### SCRUM Master
* Worked in a team of 12 to develop a clone of the popular AirBnb application. The app was capable of displaying different listings, allowing users to contact the host, book a reservation, and see all the details of a listing such as location, reviews, amenities, and similar listings nearby. Project was developed in week long sprints, in which each team member was responsible for a different component. Serving as SCRUM master I was able to gain experience managing a team's work flow and keeping track of the progress of the many components. 

### Blood Sugar Buddy - Diabetes Tracker
#### Creator/Owner
* Developed a local application that allows a diabetic to store and track their blood sugar values. The user can enter values that are passed to the database, and can then view that table in easy to read tables, graphs, and numeric indicators so the user can more easily track their blood sugar values as a diabetic. Application accessed a third party API from the US Department of Agriculture which would return the carbohydrate value for a searched item of food, which the user could then use to make informed decisions about how much insulin they should take per meal.
