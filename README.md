## Projects


### FindMyParadise
#### SCRUM Master
* Worked in a team of 12 to develop a clone of the popular AirBnb application. The app was capable of displaying different listings, allowing users to contact the host, book a reservation, and see all the details of a listing such as location, reviews, amenities, and similar listings nearby. It was developed in Vue, along with Java and MySQL using Hibernate. Project was developed in week long sprints, in which each team member was responsible for a different component. Serving as SCRUM master I was able to gain experience managing a team's work flow and keeping track of the progress of the many components. 

### Blood Sugar Buddy - Diabetes Tracker
#### Creator/Owner
* Developed a local application that allows a diabetic to store and track their blood sugar values. The user can enter values that are passed to the database, and can then view that table in easy to read tables, graphs, and numeric indicators so the user can more easily track their blood sugar values as a diabetic. Application accessed a third party API from the US Department of Agriculture which would return the carbohydrate value for a searched item of food, which the user could then use to make informed decisions about how much insulin they should take per meal.

### Medieval Chess Variant
#### SCRUM Master
* Capstone project that was developed in a team of 7 using an Agile workflow. Three month-long sprints were used to deliver the project which was a fully functional chess board application. The rules of the game varied, as each piece had different attack, move, and attribute values. For example, Bishops ated as archers and could attack at a distance. Each side was comprised of 3 garrisons that separated the pieces, each with its own commander (King and the two Bishops). The commanders were responsible for analyzing the board and making educated moves, as each side was given three moves per turn. A dice roll mechanic was implemented when attacking to include a factor for luck. The opponent could be played by either another player or an AI opponent. I was responsbile for organizing the team workflow, as well as planning and developing the AI logic for commanders and the opponent.
